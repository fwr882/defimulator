# Defimulator Project
This project is meant to be a Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Game Boy and Game Boy
Color emulator for Windows/Linux/Mac.

## History and Goals
This project was forked from the higan project at v074.  The purpose is to
maintain the existing emulation engine that was present in that version of
higan (or bsnes) while also adding modern features.  Features like OpenGL
Core profile, or finding an alternative to using OSS/ALSA for cross-platform
support.  Unifying the GUI toolkit would also be a great addition.  However,
if you're looking for the original higan project you can find the code at
https://gitlab.com/higan/higan and the actual project page at
https://byuu.org/emulation/higan/

## Why

### Accurate but Fast Emulation
The higan project is very heavily focused on 100% accurate emulation.  Which
has a purpose.  But for those that are looking for a nice emulator that is
'good enough', higan has outgrown that intent.  This project aims to support
accurate emulation while remaining usable on reasonably (within the past few
years) hardware.

### Open Development
The higan project is developed, from what I'm able to observe, by one guy.
I can tell this guy (byuu) has some real coding chops, but his repository
is not open, at least from my observations, for others to contribute.
Anyone is welcome to contribue to defimulator here on Github.

## How to Help
Fork the repository and open a pull request!  I welcome any code changes for
defimulator that will move the project forward.  Open an issue and submit a
PR against it for bonus points.
